# PDFreactor Utils

> Small utility belt for JavaScript within HTML documents rendered with [PDFreactor](https://pdfreactor.com)

This library is a (growing) collection of useful JavaScript functions when rendering PDF documents based on HTML and the [CSS Paged Media standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-page/).
Since some functions (currently just one) are intended to be used when building charts with [d3.js](https://d3js.org/), this is a peer dependency of this library.

You probably want to jump directly to the [API documentation](docs/api/index.md).
